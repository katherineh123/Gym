# Hermes Agent

Runs [Hermes](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) inside a task sandbox through
Gym's agent-session interface. The agent server stays outside as an adapter.

## Configure and run

[configs/hermes_agent.yaml](configs/hermes_agent.yaml) is the default harness definition.
The benchmark owns task data, preparation, verification, and task sandbox settings.
The harness owns its runtime and model/tool loop. The Environment Server binds the two
and closes the agent before verification.

Run from the Gym repository root with Gym and the benchmark's preparation dependencies
installed. For SWE-bench Pro, save this composition as `run.yaml`:

```yaml
config_paths:
  - resources_servers/swebench_pro/configs/swebench_pro.yaml
  - responses_api_agents/hermes_agent/configs/hermes_agent.yaml
  - environment_servers/single_agent_turn_legacy/configs/single_agent_turn_legacy.yaml

single_agent_turn_legacy:
  environment_servers:
    single_agent_turn_legacy:
      resources_server:
        name: swebench_pro_resources_server
      agent_server:
        name: hermes_agent
      resources_tool_transports: []

hermes_agent:
  responses_api_agents:
    hermes_agent:
      enabled_toolsets: [terminal]
```

Supply the `policy_model` Gym Model Server, `policy_model_name`, and `sandbox` provider in
`model-provider.yaml`. The agent's `model` defaults to `${policy_model_name}` and remains
overridable. The sandbox must be able to reach the Model Server.

```bash
python benchmarks/swebench/pro/prepare.py

gym env start --config run.yaml --config model-provider.yaml

gym eval run --no-serve \
  --config run.yaml --config model-provider.yaml \
  --agent hermes_agent \
  -i benchmarks/swebench/data/swebench_pro_benchmark.jsonl \
  -o rollouts.jsonl --limit 3 --concurrency 3
```

The collector calls Environment Server `/run`: seed Resources, seed the agent, call its
rollout-prefixed `/v1/responses`, close the agent, verify, then close Resources. Prepared
flat rows use `single_agent_turn_legacy` with this native session lifecycle; no additional
materialization script is needed. Collection does not call the agent's compatibility `/run`.
Pass the same configuration to startup and `--no-serve` collection; collection does not
inherit routing settings from the running servers.

### Switch harness or benchmark

To change a compatible harness, replace its config import, harness-specific settings,
the Environment Server's `agent_server.name`, and the collection command's `--agent`.
Keep benchmark data, preparation, and verifier settings unchanged. To change a compatible
benchmark, replace its Resources config/reference and prepared input, keeping the harness
definition unchanged. Check tool grants, task-image/runtime support, model API, and the
benchmark's declared `allowed_agents` before running a new pairing.

Use this explicit composition for now. `--agent` selects a configured agent; it does not
install or rebind one. The existing `--agent-type` swap and automatic benchmark-data lookup
still depend on legacy Agent-to-Resources bindings; they are not equivalent to this workflow.
Existing [Hermes SWE-Pro recipes](../../benchmarks/swebench/pro/hermes.yaml) remain supported
for compatibility; a new pairing does not need another combined preset.

## Configuration example

```yaml
hermes_agent:
  responses_api_agents:
    hermes_agent:
      entrypoint: app.py
      resources_server: null
      model_server:
        type: responses_api_models
        name: policy_model
      model: ${policy_model_name}
      enabled_toolsets: [terminal, file, code_execution]
      max_turns: 30
      concurrency: 32
      temperature: 1.0
      sandbox_provider: sandbox
      sandbox_config:
        image: my-agent-image
        ttl_s: 3600
        workdir: /workspace
      system_prompt: |
        your system prompt here.
```

| field | default | description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled_toolsets` | `null` (all) | forwarded to `AIAgent(enabled_toolsets=...)` |
| `disabled_toolsets` | `null` | forwarded to `AIAgent(disabled_toolsets=...)` |
| `model` | `${policy_model_name}` in the default YAML | served model ID; configs that omit it retain the legacy `model_server.name` fallback |
| `resources_server` | `null` | required only for the agent's compatibility `/run`; Environment Server binds Resources for native sessions |
| `max_turns` | `30` | maps to `AIAgent.max_iterations` |
| `concurrency` | `32` | max simultaneous `run()` calls |
| `temperature` | `null` | sampling temperature passed to `AIAgent`; request `temperature` overrides it, including `0.0` |
| `terminal_backend` | `local` | sets `TERMINAL_ENV` (process-global); `local`, `docker`, `daytona`, `modal`, `ssh` |
| `terminal_timeout` | `60` | sets `TERMINAL_TIMEOUT` (process-global); per-command wall-clock seconds |
| `sandbox_provider` | `null` | named provider used to create an agent-owned sandbox when Resources does not supply `sandbox_access` |
| `sandbox_config` | `{}` | `SandboxSpec` fields used with `sandbox_provider`; ignored when Resources supplies a sandbox |
| `sandbox_runner_timeout_seconds` | `21600` | bounds one sandbox activation; the episode deadline still applies |
| `system_prompt` | `null` | joined with request `instructions` and the first input system message, in that order; appended to Hermes' built-in prompt |
| `session_close_retry_window_seconds` | `300` | session close receipt retention from successful cleanup; retries do not extend expiry |

The model-server url is resolved at request time and passed to `AIAgent(base_url=..., api_key="gym")`. <!-- pragma: allowlist secret -->

Host and sandbox execution use the same request rules. User tasks remain user messages.
Request `model` must match the configured model. Unsupported non-default controls return
HTTP 422, including `top_p` (even `1.0`), `store`, `service_tier`, and request metadata.
`max_output_tokens` also returns 422: Hermes does not enforce a total response token budget.
Config `max_tokens` limits each model call. Only text input is supported; `developer` messages
are rejected.

Compatibility: the host path previously let config `system_prompt` replace the dataset's
system message and ignored request `temperature`. It now combines the prompts and honors
the request temperature, just like sandbox execution. These changes can affect scores.
Remove unsupported fields that older versions silently ignored.

## Runtime and model requirements

Sandbox sessions live in the memory of the worker that seeded them, so seeding a session requires `num_workers: 1`. Calling the agent's `/run` directly keeps no session and still supports several workers.

Each sandbox session installs the Hermes version pinned in `requirements.txt`, the same one this server runs, at seed time unless it already imports from `/tmp/nemo-gym-hermes-runtime-<commit>/venv`, for example because the image bakes it in or an earlier session in the same sandbox installed it. Installing needs outbound access to GitHub and the Python package index. Hermes calls the Model Server directly from the sandbox, so the sandbox must also reach the Model Server at its configured host and port. Its image must also match the host CPU architecture and C library because the host's `uv` executable is copied into the sandbox.

Sessions use MCP tool grants and reject other required grants. Each granted MCP server is added to that session's Hermes configuration, so the sandbox must reach it at the granted URL, usually the Resources Server's `/mcp` endpoint. An activation fails before its first model call when a required server does not connect. Hermes names MCP tools `mcp_<server>_<tool>`; the response reports them as `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, the form Gym strips before verification, while captured model calls keep Hermes' names. The session token in each grant is readable inside the sandbox and gives access only to that episode's tools.

The Hermes runner and the model's terminal tool execute as the same user in the same sandbox. The host reads the final result, including token IDs, from `/tmp/nemo-gym-hermes-sessions/<session-id>/output.json`; commands issued by the model can also write that file. Sandbox mode is suitable for evaluation, but it must not be used to produce RL training data until results are returned through a channel the model cannot modify.

## Local compatibility

Calls without an agent session run Hermes on the agent-server host. They do not operate on
a Resources-owned task sandbox. The agent's compatibility `/run` requires an explicit
`resources_server`; native sessions and direct `/v1/responses` do not.

The default YAML now selects native composition rather than acting as an unbound legacy
swap source. Legacy swap configurations must explicitly restore
`resources_server: {type: resources_servers, name: "???"}` on the agent. Existing bound
recipes, including `hermes_math` and `swebench/pro/hermes`, keep their bindings.

For the existing host-side math example, put `policy_base_url`, `policy_api_key`, and
`policy_model_name` in `env.yaml`, then run:

```bash
gym env start --config environments/hermes_math/config.yaml --model-type openai_model

gym eval run --no-serve \
  --config environments/hermes_math/config.yaml --model-type openai_model \
  --agent hermes_math_agent \
  --input environments/hermes_math/data/example.jsonl \
  --output hermes_agent_rollout.jsonl --limit 1
```

Example math rollouts are in `environments/hermes_math/data/example_rollouts.jsonl`.
