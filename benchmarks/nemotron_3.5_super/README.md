## Run production evals
Results will appear in that checkpoint folder.

### Typical job shapes
These job shapes have been tuned to finish evaluation on Nemotron 3.5 Super checkpoints within a 4 hour Slurm timeout window. All compute numbers assume GB200 NVL72. The batched evaluations below have separately measured runtimes; the core batch required an explicit resume.

|Name|Argument|
|---|---|
|Prefill nodes|`NUM_PREFILL_NODES=<>`|
|Decode nodes|`NUM_DECODE_NODES=<>`|
|Concurrency|`++num_samples_in_parallel=<>`|

|Benchmark|Harness|Prefill nodes|Decode nodes|Concurrency|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|SWE Bench Verified + Multilingual|OpenCode|2|2|1024|
|SWE Bench Pro|OpenCode|4|6|1024|
|DeepSWE (1 repeat)|OpenCode|2|2|1024|
|Terminal Bench 2.1|Terminus 2|2|8|512|
|Terminal Bench 2.1|OpenCode|?|?|?|

### Batched evaluations

Several benchmarks can share one model-serving deployment while retaining separate tasks, scores, and completion status. Gym interleaves attempts across agents under one global concurrency limit and preserves other agents' metrics if one agent's aggregation fails.

| Batch | Members | Suite configuration | Global concurrency ceiling |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| Core | Tau2, Tau3 banking, SciCode, HLE, GPQA Diamond, Omniscience, AA-LCR, APEX math shortlist, LMArena v2, LiveCodeBench v6, IFBench | [benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/core_text.yaml](core_text.yaml) | 512 |
| SWE | SWE-bench Verified and Multilingual | [benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/swebench_verified_multilingual.yaml](swebench_verified_multilingual.yaml) | 1,024 |

**SWE-bench Pro remains standalone and is excluded from both batches.** Both tested configurations use 2 prefill nodes and 2 decode nodes: 4 nodes with 4 GPUs each, or 16 GPUs total.

The SWE batch shares 4 nodes (16 GPUs), compared with 8 nodes (32 GPUs) when running Verified and Multilingual as separate 4-node jobs at the same time.

The suite files define which benchmarks run together and how many evaluation attempts can run at once. The Gym-only run recipes in [benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/batch_configs/core.yaml](batch_configs/core.yaml) and [benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/batch_configs/swe.yaml](batch_configs/swe.yaml) retain the pilot's global concurrency, repeat, and sampling settings. You supply the checkpoint, compatible serving container, Slurm account, and credentials. The core recipe now uses the Super 3.5 reference models.

The core recipe also matches the reference HLE answer-extraction rule, Omniscience's 2,048-token judge output budget, and LMArena's 1% tolerated failure rate. HLE answers longer than 8,192 characters become empty answers in the judge prompt; they are not truncated.

Some runtime settings still differ from standalone recipes. HLE and Omniscience each allow 32 concurrent judge requests, compared with 64 and 16 in the reference. Omniscience uses 10 dataset repeats and IFBench uses eight, compared with eight and five in their base benchmark configs. Both batch commands also load [benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/policy_model_override.yaml](policy_model_override.yaml), which clears model-level output-token limits. Matched standalone comparisons must use the same repeat, seed, sampling, and output-limit settings; matching the auxiliary models alone is not enough.

The prepared SWE inputs already include three copies of each task. Use `num_repeats=1` and `num_repeats_add_seed=false` during collection so Gym doesn’t add more repeats or sampling seeds.

Submit either full batch with [benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/submit_batch.sh](submit_batch.sh). It checks the configuration, then calls [benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/sbatch_external_vllm.sh](sbatch_external_vllm.sh) to submit the job. Serving allocation settings and Gym configuration are separate:

- Launcher environment variables `NUM_PREFILL_NODES` and `NUM_DECODE_NODES` default to `2` each, matching the tested four-node allocation. Each node has four GPUs.
- In Gym YAML configuration or Hydra overrides, `num_samples_in_parallel` sets one shared limit on active evaluation attempts. Use a positive value; `0` is invalid, and an absent setting or `null` means no global limit. Since the suites set a default, pass `++num_samples_in_parallel=null` to remove it. `num_repeats` and `num_repeats_add_seed` accept per-agent mappings with an `_default` value, preserving each benchmark's repeat and seed policy. For example:

  ```yaml
  num_samples_in_parallel: 512
  num_repeats: {_default: 1, lmarena_v2_benchmark_agent: 3}
  num_repeats_add_seed: {_default: false, lmarena_v2_benchmark_agent: true}
  ```

  All agents share the 512 slots. LMArena gets three collection attempts per prepared row, with added seeds; other agents use the repeat and seed defaults. Collection repeats multiply any repeats already in the prepared inputs.

- When `batch_manifest_fpath` is supplied, Gym validates the declared members and input fingerprints before dispatch, then writes per-agent progress and aggregation state to `batch_status.json` beside the manifest. Tracking currently requires legacy agent-style rows with `agent_ref.name` and `task_source`, plus non-negative integer `_ng_task_index` and `_ng_rollout_index`; leave `batch_manifest_fpath` unset for native rows (`task_id.taskset` plus `task_input`) or mixed-format batches. A shared metrics file alone does not prove every member is complete; inspect each member's counts and aggregation state. Successful collection also does not replace a review of infrastructure failures and score validity.

  Example: set `batch_manifest_fpath: results/swe-batch/batch_manifest.json` to an existing manifest, then inspect `jq '.members' results/swe-batch/batch_status.json`. A member with `completed_rollout_count: 6`, `expected_rollout_count: 6`, and `aggregation_status: "error"` has finished collection but does not have successfully aggregated metrics.

For Gym-only submission, install the checkout with `uv sync --frozen --extra dev` and make the required benchmark data available in that checkout. The checkout is mounted over the container's `/opt/Gym`, so data available only in the image will be hidden. Configure `sandbox.opensandbox.connection` in the untracked `env.yaml`, or export `OPENSANDBOX_DOMAIN` and `OPENSANDBOX_API_KEY`. Core also needs `nv_inference_api_key` in `env.yaml` or an exported `NV_INFERENCE_API_KEY` for the recipe's NVIDIA-hosted judge and simulated-user endpoints. Never commit credentials. The SWE recipe uses the remote OpenCode assets configured in [benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/sandbox_utils.yaml](sandbox_utils.yaml); those must be available to your sandboxes.

Replace the paths and account below with your own. The image must provide `/opt/Gym_venv`, all required server environments under `/opt/uv_venvs`, and vLLM compatible with [benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/vllm_configs/batched.sh](vllm_configs/batched.sh). Historical core and SWE smoke tests passed with `results/containers/super35-batches-v0271-6b5a02298-20260921-r2.sqsh`, using vLLM `0.27.1+precompiled` and a patched `vllm-router` `0.1.15` wheel built in the same ARM64 base image. This identifies the tested serving setup, not validation of the updated recipe.

Follow [Batch builds](#batch-builds) to build dependencies for your checkout and the [router-wheel instructions](#vllm-router-patch-decode-node-cache-imbalance) for the current router fixes; evaluation jobs reuse the installed dependencies. This serving config retains the pilot's flags and requires `config.json`, `chat_template.jinja`, and `ultra_v3_reasoning_parser.py` in the checkpoint directory. A different container/checkpoint combination needs validation. These examples request 20 hours on `batch_long` to accommodate the core batch's measured runtime; choose a partition and limit supported by your cluster.

```bash
# Full core batch
MODEL=/shared/checkpoints/super35/hf \
CONTAINER=/shared/containers/super35-gym.sqsh \
SBATCH_ACCOUNT=my-slurm-account \
SBATCH_PARTITION=batch_long \
SBATCH_TIMELIMIT=20:00:00 \
EXPERIMENT_NAME=super35-core-run1 \
ROLLOUTS_FPATH=results/super35-core-run1/rollouts.jsonl \
bash benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/submit_batch.sh core \
   ++resume_from_cache=true

# Full SWE-bench Verified + Multilingual batch
MODEL=/shared/checkpoints/super35/hf \
CONTAINER=/shared/containers/super35-gym.sqsh \
SBATCH_ACCOUNT=my-slurm-account \
SBATCH_PARTITION=batch_long \
SBATCH_TIMELIMIT=20:00:00 \
EXPERIMENT_NAME=super35-swe-run1 \
ROLLOUTS_FPATH=results/super35-swe-run1/rollouts.jsonl \
bash benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/submit_batch.sh swe \
   ++resume_from_cache=true
```

Append `--check` to either command to check local paths and resolve configuration without submitting a job, opening the container, installing dependencies, or checking live services. Append `--config path/to/overrides.yaml` or Hydra overrides such as `++num_samples_in_parallel=256` to customize the recipe. The same arguments reach the in-container dependency check and evaluation. Keep extra config files in the checkout, or expose their paths through `MOUNTS`. `MODEL_NAME`, `SBATCH_QOS`, and the node counts are optional environment overrides; `GYM_PYTHON` can select a local Python environment instead of `.venv/bin/python`.

The launcher mounts the checkout and checkpoint automatically but preserves the image's `/opt/uv_venvs`; do not mount an empty host directory over it. Before preparation, it checks Gym imports and the required server environment paths. Missing environments stop the job with a rebuild instruction instead of triggering installation. These checks do not verify every installed package or live service, and GPU smoke tests are still required for a new image. The launcher does not depend on root-level pilot helpers or earlier jobs.

By default, each submission gets a fresh experiment name and timestamped output. To resume, use the same checkpoint and evaluation settings, set `EXPERIMENT_NAME` and `ROLLOUTS_FPATH` to the original name and saved output, and append `++resume_from_cache=true` to the command. For requeue recovery, supply the explicit output path and override on the initial submission. The experiment name alone does not enable resume; without the override, Gym clears existing output at an explicitly selected path. Preserve the materialized inputs and wait for the preceding job and cleanup to finish before manually resubmitting.

### Open problems
1. We can't reduce the number of prefill nodes because the TRT LLM kernel isn't large enough to support higher max_num_batched_tokens
2. Once MTP is functional with PD-disagg / async scheduling / prefix caching / etc, we should be able to reduce the decode nodes as well.

### Tuning and debug protocol

Prerequisites for tuning and debugging:
1. Gym Slurm log containing the vLLM engine prints.
2. Final Gym output aggregate metrics including the harness finish rate.

1. Check if the harness finish rate is expected or not.
   1. For example, as of Mon Sep 07, the expected finish rate for TerminalBench 2.1 + Terminus 2 harness is around 90% Terminus 2 harness finish rate.
   2. If the finish rate is within the expected range, then usually things are fine from an infra perspective.
2. Inspect the vLLM engine logs in the Gym Slurm logs.
   1. Identify the prefill and decode vLLM engine logs by looking at the "Prompt throughput" and "Generation throughput". The engines that have non-zero "Prompt throughput" are the prefill engines, and the ones with non-zero "Generation throughput" are decode engines.
3. Do I need to increase compute because of waiting requests?
   1. Check if there are any "Waiting requests" on any of the engine types.
      1. The typical number of waiting requests against an engine is 0 or close to 0.
      2. If there are waiting requests built up, the number will typically be 100s or 1000s.
   2. If there are waiting requests on any of the engines, rerun the same config with an increase in the number of that engine type.
      1. For example, if the current shape is p2d2 and the decode engines have a lot of waiting requests, try increasing to p2d4.
      2. Typical shapes are powers of 2 up to whatever the max NVLink shape supported is e.g. p2d8, p2d14 (segment 16), p2d16 (segment 18), etc.
4. Do I need to increase compute because of decode speed?
   1. Check if the finish rate is non-zero and lower than you expect. It could be 3% lower or 40% lower depending on the verbosity of the checkpoint.
   2. Please refer to the decode speeds table below to see what compute shape you need to satisfy your latency requirement.
5. Did something weird happen on the vLLM engine side?
   1. If the progress rollouts/min reported in W&B is very different than usual, that may indicate a transient failure on the vLLM engine side. Try rerunning with the same config and see if the same behavior persists.
6. Is there something else wrong?
   1. Message @bxyu-nvidia @sdevare in Slack and share your Slurm logs and W&B.

#### Current vLLM decode speeds across engine batch sizes
Definitions
1. Batch size: The number of requests that the engine is currently running.
2. Engine throughput: The total tokens/s throughput for all requests, logged by vLLM every 10s interval.
3. Effective tokens/second/request (tok/s/req): Engine throughput divided by the instantaneous batch size reported by vLLM.

## Development commands

### vllm-router patch (decode-node cache imbalance)
`build_eval_container.sh` requires `VLLM_ROUTER_WHEEL` and does **not** fall back to
installing the released `vllm-router` wheel.

The released router resets every worker's in-flight load counter from the registry
health checker, every 10 health-check cycles -- 10 minutes at the default 60s
interval. The `cache_aware` policy reads those counters to decide when to abandon
prefix affinity in favour of shortest-queue routing, so the reset makes an
already-saturated worker look idle. Under P/D disaggregation
(`--vllm-pd-disaggregation --decode-policy cache_aware`, as used by
`sbatch_external_vllm.sh`) that closes a feedback loop: the worker holding the hot
prefixes keeps attracting requests, and shortest-queue never triggers to break it.

Note the reset is *unconditional*. There is a second, dead copy of the same logic in
`src/core/worker.rs` guarded by `max_load <= 2`; reading only that one leads to the
wrong conclusion that the reset fired just when workers were idle and was therefore
harmless. The one that actually ran, in `src/core/worker_registry.rs`, zeroed every
worker every 10 cycles regardless of load.

- bug: https://github.com/vllm-project/router/issues/197
- fix: https://github.com/vllm-project/router/pull/216 (unmerged upstream)

#216 on its own is not enough, and for prefill-heavy benchmarks it is worse than not
applying it. It makes the worker load counters honest, which switches on a second
latent bug: `cache_aware` decides whether to use prefix affinity from the
*fleet-wide* load spread, so one hot worker discards affinity for every request --
including requests whose own worker is idle. Under P/D that gate is open almost
permanently, because prefill worker load counts queued requests as well as running
ones. Routing degenerates to shortest-queue, already-cached prompts get recomputed,
prefill saturates and decode starves behind it.

The pin therefore points at a branch carrying #216 plus a fix that applies the same
load check per request, against the worker that request wants:

- prefill fix: https://github.com/vllm-project/router/pull/238

Both are plain commit SHAs fetched from `vllm-project/router`; a PR head is a ref
there even when the branch lives on a contributor's fork. Repin to a released commit
once these land upstream.

Build the wheel once with `build_vllm_router_wheel.sh`, then pass it to the container
build. The wheel is built inside the eval base image, so its extension module matches
the Python that runs `vllm-router` at eval time:

```bash
SBATCH_ACCOUNT=my-slurm-account \
SBATCH_PARTITION=batch \
SBATCH_QOS=interactive \
SBATCH_GRES=gpu:4 \
CONTAINER=/path/to/vllm/container \
sbatch benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/build_vllm_router_wheel.sh
# -> results/vllm_router/wheels/vllm_router-*.whl
```

The wheel's directory is mounted into the build automatically; it only has to live on
storage the compute node can read.

#### Measured effect

Two SWE-bench Multilingual runs on the released router exhibited the runaway. Both
are 2 prefill / 2 decode with 450 rollouts in parallel. Ratio is decode max/min
running requests sampled per minute, over the minutes where the busiest decode node
held at least 100 running; `starved` counts minutes where one node sat at ~0 running
while its peer was busy:

| run | router | loaded | starved | median | max | early -> late | max KV | max queued |
|-----|--------|--------|---------|--------|-----|---------------|--------|------------|
| 6800138 | stock 0.1.15 | 153m | 3 | 9.84 | 333.00 | 2.62 -> 103.50 | 100% | 224 |
| 6794553 | stock 0.1.15 | 104m | 0 | 4.72 | 183.60 | 2.28 -> 37.92 | 99.8% | 207 |
| 6802686 | #216 | 32m | 0 | 1.03 | 1.11 | 1.03 -> 1.02 | 27.8% | 0 |
| 6803266 | #216 | 34m | 0 | 1.04 | 1.14 | 1.03 -> 1.04 | 27.5% | 0 |
| 6803267 | #216 | 31m | 0 | 1.04 | 1.21 | 1.04 -> 1.02 | 27.7% | 0 |
| 6803268 | #216 | 31m | 0 | 1.04 | 1.30 | 1.06 -> 1.04 | 28.7% | 0 |
| 6803269 | #216 | 34m | 0 | 1.04 | 1.34 | 1.04 -> 1.06 | 27.9% | 0 |

Both bad runs show the same signature: an even start that diverges monotonically
(`early -> late`), ending with one decode node pinned near 100% KV cache with 200+
requests queued while its peer drains toward idle. 6800138 stalled at 583/900
rollouts. The patched runs stay flat, never queue, and hold KV below 29%.

Not every run on the released router hits this -- it needs a sustained saturated
decode regime -- so a clean run does not tell you which router you are on. Use the
fingerprint above instead.


### Build eval container

Example run:

```bash
SBATCH_ACCOUNT=my-slurm-account \
SBATCH_PARTITION=batch \
INPUT_CONTAINER=/path/to/vllm/container \
OUTPUT_CONTAINER=/path/to/vllm/container___with_gym.sqsh \
VLLM_ROUTER_WHEEL=/path/to/vllm_router/whl \
MOUNTS=/path/to/env.yaml:/opt/Gym/env.yaml:x-create=file,/path/to/config.yaml:/opt/Gym/config.yaml:x-create=file \
GYM_CONFIG=benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/eval_container_config.yaml \
sbatch --gres=gpu:4 \
  benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/build_eval_container.sh
```


#### Batch builds

For one image covering both core and SWE batches, reuse the shared build config and add `--config benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/core_text.yaml` after the script name. The suite adds the LMArena, LiveCodeBench, IFBench, and APEX dependencies missing from the shared config; it does not select which batch runs afterward.

```bash
mkdir -p results/containers slurm-logs
INPUT_CONTAINER=/shared/containers/super35-vllm-base.sqsh \
OUTPUT_CONTAINER="$PWD/results/containers/super35-gym.sqsh" \
VLLM_ROUTER_WHEEL=/shared/wheels/vllm_router-0.1.15-cp38-abi3-linux_aarch64.whl \
MOUNTS="$PWD:/build-source:ro" \
NEMO_GYM_GIT_URL=/build-source \
NEMO_GYM_GIT_REF="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
GYM_CONFIG=benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/eval_container_config.yaml \
SKIP_PREPARE=1 \
sbatch --account=my-slurm-account --partition=cpu \
  --nodes=1 --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=8 --mem=32G --time=02:00:00 \
  benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/build_eval_container.sh \
  --config benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/core_text.yaml
```

Set `CONTAINER` in both batch run commands to the resulting image. The batch launcher reuses its installed environments rather than installing dependencies during evaluation. Keep benchmark data in the checkout mounted by the launcher.


### Launch vLLM
This script assumes:
- GB200s which are 4 GPUs per node. If you want to use 8 GPUs per node, update the --tensor-parallel-size and --gres=gpu arguments to 8.
- Nemotron 3 Ultra configs e.g. with the parser configs.

Example run:
```bash
MODEL=/path/to/model \
NUM_NODES=4 \
SBATCH_ACCOUNT=my-slurm-account \
SBATCH_PARTITION=batch \
CONTAINER=/path/to/vllm/container \
MOUNTS=/shared/fs:/shared/fs \
bash benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/sbatch_external_vllm.sh
```


### Interactive development on GPUs with Ray cluster
Example run:
```bash
NUM_NODES=4 \
SBATCH_ACCOUNT=my-slurm-account \
SBATCH_PARTITION=batch \
SBATCH_GRES=gpu:4 \
CONTAINER=/path/to/vllm/container \
MOUNTS=/shared/fs:/shared/fs \
bash scripts/sbatch_interactive.sh
```


### Run eval against external vLLM endpoint
This script assumes:
- The container is one built via benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/build_eval_container.sh
- GB200s which are 4 GPUs per node. If you want to use 8 GPUs per node, update the --tensor-parallel-size and --gres=gpu arguments to 8.
- Nemotron 3 Ultra configs e.g. with the parser configs.

If you want to use your own custom local Gym, please mount:
```bash
MOUNTS=/shared/fs:/shared/fs,/path/to/custom/local/Gym:/opt/Gym
```
The existing Gym venv and individual server venvs will still use the ones baked into the container.

Example run:
```bash
MODEL=/path/to/model \
EXPERIMENT_NAME=my-experiment-name \
NUM_NODES=4 \
SBATCH_ACCOUNT=my-slurm-account \
SBATCH_PARTITION=batch \
CONTAINER=/path/to/vllm/container \
MOUNTS=/shared/fs:/shared/fs \
bash benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/sbatch_eval_with_external_vllm.sh \
--config benchmarks/my-benchmark/config.yaml
```
